This is the readme file of Julia Roemer and Lenny Werner's Web Programming Project called "The Quizzard of Oz". 

The Quizzard of Oz is a quiz about five Disney movies. These five movies are "The Lion King", "Aladdin", "Frozen", "The Beauty and the Beast" and "Tangled". On the website, you can choose between a certain number of questions and a specific movie. If a certain number is chosen, a corresponding number of questions are randomly selected from the range of questions. If a specific movie is chosen, all questions regarding this movie are asked. When an answer is selected, it will turn light green if correct and light red if incorrect. At the end, the player is congratulated. If one or more questions were answered correctly, confetti will also appear.
The quiz is especially suitable for Disney fans and people who enjoy quizzes.
Our goal was to offer different variations for players to choose from. Whether we succeeded, you can test for yourself right away. Instructions on how to proceed are described below.
